# Trading At Market Close

In minute mode `handle_data` is called every minute which is okay when checking for intraday signals, but what if you wanted to execute your code only once per day? `is_market_close()` is a method that checks if itâ€™s currently at the market close and returns True if it is and False otherwise.

An example use of the method would be if you wanted to order a security at the close price, you would first call `is_market_close()`: e.g. 

```
def handle_data(context,data):
    if (is_market_close()):
        order(5000, sid)
```

This would execute orders at 4:00PM. It also takes into account early closes such as the Friday after Thanksgiving where the market closes at 1 PM.

`is_market_close()` takes in a `minutes_early` integer, which will return True at 4:00PM - `minutes_early`. 

```
is_market_close(5)
```

The above snippet would return True at 3:55PM, BUT will also return `True` for every minute after 3:55PM. This is to account for missing bars in data (e.g. if data doesn't exist for the minute bar at 3:55PM, the order will execute at 3:56PM instead). That being said, an order function that uses a smart target (e.g. reweighting for a target X weight of security Y) is recommended if passing in an `minutes_early` integer, otherwise, your order function will execute at 3:55PM, 3:56 PM, 3:57PM and etc. 

So the following order function would order SPY 500 time instead of just 100
```
if(is_market_close(5)):
	order(100, sid)
```
