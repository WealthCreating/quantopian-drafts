# Trading At Market Close

In minute mode `handle_data` is called every minute which is okay when checking for intraday signals, but what if you wanted to execute your code only once per day? `endofday_check` is a method that checks if itâ€™s currently at the market close and returns True if it is and False otherwise

An example use of the method would be if you wanted to order a security at the close price, you would first call `endofday_check`: e.g. 

```
def handle_data(context,data):
    if (endofday_check()):
        order(5000, sid)
```

This would execute orders at 3:45 PM (the last time that the NYSE accepts orders). It also takes into account early closes such as the Friday after Thanksgiving where the market closes at 1 PM. 

`endofday_check` takes in a `minutes_early` integer, which will return True at 3:45 PM - `minutes_early`. 

So the following would return True at 3:40PM

```
endofday_check(5)
```
